                Simulation
            </h1>
            The equations that are used in the model are simplified from the shallow water equations in order to make
            simulation easier. They describe propagation of linear gravity waves in a shallow body of water.

            The simulation uses the Arakawa grid [1] that is shown below. The velocities' grid is offset from the height
            grid in
            order to
            represent flow between height cells. If the velocity components were not offset then the water velocities
            would represent net flux of water at a given point rather then the velocity of water between two grid cells.

            The discretized equations used in the water simulation are shown below. Equations (1,2) calculate velocities
            and equation (3) calculates the
            change in height. Equations (4,5) define the half indicies used in equation (3).

            <h1>Time Stepping Scheme</h1>
            The simulation uses the Matsuno time stepping scheme. The Matsuno scheme is used rather then a simple
            explicit time
            stepping scheme
            because it results in a more stable simulation. If an simple explicit time step was used then the model can
            start oscillations leading to instability. Let us define the Matsuno scheme for the following vector
            equation:
            <div class="img">
                <img src="equation4.png">
                <!--
\frac{dX}{dt} = F(x)
                -->
            </div>
            First a half time step is taken as shown below,
            <div class="img">
                <img src="equation5.png">
                <!--
X^{n+\frac{1}{2}} = X^n+\frac{\Delta t}{2} F\left(X^n\right)
                -->
            </div>
            Next a full time step forward is taken using the information generated from the half time step.
            <div class="img">
                <img src="equation6.png">
                <!--
X^{n+1} = X^n+\frac{\Delta t}{2} F\left(X^{n+1/2}\right)
            -->
            </div>
            Next a full time step forward is taken using the information generated from the half time step.
            The scheme is a modification of the well known family of Runge-Kutta time stepping schemes [2] which is
            widely used in other fields.
            <h1>
                Limitations of Model
            </h1>
            The model inherits the limitations form the shallow water equations as discussed in the Shallow Water
            Equations Section. The model is also unstable under high time steps which could be explained by the
            simulation overshooting the correct result when simulating a timestep.
