            At this stage the model is not stable and most of the time was spent on making the model stable and making
            the model interactive. The model could be improved by adding support for uneven surfaces. Once uneven
            surfaces are added
            support
            for erosion could then be added. One foreseen difficulty would be stability of the model under high
            velocities and with large gradients in water heights. Instability is a difficult problem and a potential
            solution may be a more sophisticated formulation of viscosity. Another direction to take the project to
            could be
            to use the web technology developed and use it to create an interactive demo or game in order
            to
            explain some kind of hydrodynamics phenomenon such as for example river erosion. Shown below is an
            example of an educational game, Cities Skylines. The game includes water simulation and it can teach players
            about how to design a city that is resilient to flooding.
